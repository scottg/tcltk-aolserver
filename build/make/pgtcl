# Usage:
#
# lappend auto_path "$env(EXE)/pgtcl/lib"
# package require Pgtcl
#
# -or-
#
# load $env(EXE)/pgtcl/lib/pgtcl1.5/libpgtcl1.5g.dylib Pgtcl

# By default, the actual lib binary is installed within Tcl's lib area. To make
# the lib binary install somewhere else, use following, but be aware that you
# have to figure out how your tcl script will find the library ('load' will
# work, but 'package require' won't unless you add the new path to auto_path).
#
#	--libdir=$EXE/pgtcl/lib

# To compile with openssl, use the following.  I think this will use the
# system's version of openssl by default; to use a local version you'll have to
# point to it (??? how?).
#
#	--with-openssl

make
make install
