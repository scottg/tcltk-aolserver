# By default, the actual lib binary is installed within Tcl's lib area. To make
# the lib binary install somewhere else, use following, but be aware that you
# have to figure out how your tcl script will find the library (direct 'load'
# will work, but 'package require' won't unless you add the new path to
# auto_path).
#
#	--libdir=$EXE/tls/lib
#
# To update auto_path manually:
#
#	lappend auto_path "$env(EXE)/tls/lib" (optional)

# This will use the system's version of openssl by default. To compile with the
# local version of openssl, use the following.  
#
#	XXX FIX
#	--with-openssl (???)
#	--with-ssl-dir=???
