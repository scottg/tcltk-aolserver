# This is the AOLserver hosts.alow file. It allows you to specify which
# hosts may log in as certain users. If you have an entry in this
# file for a given user, you may not have an entry in hosts.deny for
# that same user.

# Example:
#
# nsadmin: 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0, .internal.mycompany.com, home.me.com
