AOLserver Build for Tcl/Tk 2008 Conference
------------------------------------------

This distribution contains the sources and build scripts to compile and install
AOLserver and supporting software and modules on most Unix type systems (sorry,
no Windows here)..

All files and software reside in the directory you are currently in, so no
worry about files being installed all over your system. Still, you should *not*
be root when working here and am not liable for any problems you have with this
kit.
