AOLserver Build for Tcl/Tk 2008 Conference
------------------------------------------
Copyright 2008 by Scott S. Goodwin

This distribution contains the sources and build scripts to compile and install
AOLserver and supporting software and modules on most Unix type systems (sorry,
no Windows here)..

All files and software reside in the directory you are currently in, so no
worry about files being installed all over your system. Still, you should *not*
be root when working here and am not liable for any problems you have with this
kit.

Four step process:

./build.sh
./db init
./db start
./web start

If BUILD_DEBUG="yes" in config.sh then all of the build output will be captured
in the build.log file; set to anything else and build.sh doesn't bother
capturing the action.

If NS_DEBUG="yes" in config.sh then 'web start' will start nsd in the
foreground; anything else will cause it to start as a normal daemon.

Then connect to the IP address with your browser on ports 8000 (http) and 8001
(https). If you're on a Mac, 127.0.0.1 will be the server's address; otherwise
it should be the main interface's IP.

All of the binaries get installed under the 'exe' subdirectory. You can remove
the 'exe' and 'var' directories and start over at any time.

Note that you'll likely see some compile or install errors for static libraries
for nsopenssl etc.
